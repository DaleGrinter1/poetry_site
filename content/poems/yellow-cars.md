flourishing into remembrance
i’m blushing down into two
the white mall stripped along down the pier wash the beers down with my food
my friends called me late at night to ask me if i’ve heard from you, I lied.
a brisk walk this afternoon flipped my android watch into a colossal route of rotation; from waking up in the wrong city; having not heard from you; a girl can only try.
hey baby how’s new zealand?
