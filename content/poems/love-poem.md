I’m writing a love poem

Vertigo to my head, alcohol to my brain.
But your keep me at bay, lie eyes open while the pillow took my mind where my head was. You once woke me out of it and you told me that I was your best justifiable trait, your ADHD, your video game.
Then i’ll be up in the morning, make a pact about the insane resistances you have about my lifestyle i’ll wave and say, ill be seeing you! over mimosas in the bay.

But you’ll never see me again. My presence.
Preservatives of strain, calm, collected depressants; and green juice for my pain: for your morning cup of coffee.
Oh how good I would feel for her love to butter you up.

Leave you in pines that serves a lot of good people and you can rely on them everyday.
Boy we were districts of pleasure with no meaning. Ironically It is another love poem, vertigo from the bed, alcohol bled on the window pane.

I’d be just mean if I answered you now.
let go of the girl that came alive in your dreams, let go of that girl for me.
