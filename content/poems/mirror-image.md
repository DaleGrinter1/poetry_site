I see you looking for me
I know life is in parts and livings too hard but your wavering away.
Yeah i heard you, before you speak your missing tone, your wishing influence, your playful backbone your controversy, worry’s throwing you away like mouthwash, it’s grey here,
if making wishes today is working for my wage.
The night shift of worry is over , no worries all beneath yourself.
Look at me i’m sorry about it too.
Beneath you lies no way out, but i’m counting on it.
Make amends for religion, for rules, regulations and that girl that made you feel incapable.
Answers i’ll give you, your mind in markers, plaster your performance on the street.
Your panting fantasising in races while you sleep, i’m lullaby’s in the silent times for you i’m the sunshine put the night time on pause for you.
I see you wanting me. I’m already here
