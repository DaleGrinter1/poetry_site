here’s my audition

Moving slowly towards your music.
Swallowed the syringe bottle hard that i’m down packing.
Evolving the madness generalising all these beautiful sounds that heard me rain down; priceless cruising in the yacht club.
Merciful angels dancing,
Charmers at the door, and better worth it status quo stitch-ups for more.
I must have missed the warmness, the tingling diva feeling I should have felt, piss drunk on the floor.
Beats that feeling.
The feeling of the sounds of heavens on earth being given to me.
Nobody noticed my hidden existence before. My brittle body.
Hear my grief, my morning after, another rug for the table, oh poor bartender, who gets tired when my tears run free.
A reality too close to me that my daydreams are put on pause.
Carry my soul back to the street. Before they call someone friendly; some angry strange man who can “sort that out” for me.
