Believe me when I say we are all playing a game of nothing,
turn your phone upside down.
It’s brittle works raved down what is fine art; put your flame to rest, threw it down the stairs as turmoil.
Society’s not so societal views on desensitised fine art.
I’m not trembling, you are.
Misfits of our kind and one of yourself.
Scream if we are all just playing a game.
Believe me when I say we are playing a case of fraud; your name will never be the same; no rest, no reward. It threw it down the stairs like the rest tumbling down a feeling of fleeting to the less depressed,
but i’m insanely okay on the shelf.
