“What began my uncertain fate?”

In a flaw of conditional, financially unable, spirit warn thin on this parched door handle; she opened it and I felt my life slip away.
A infidelity complexity; unable to keep an eye on the prize, everyone worried about feeling incredibly thirsty, I wish time would take me away with you liz.

“Was there a goodbye note?”

In that fatal hour Jane Austin bled for you, short term happiness is the devils antidote, and i’m sorry I couldn’t be freedom for you. Couldn’t live with the wrong man.

“She’ll be packing up her things in the morning if you wanted to go check on her.”

The memories, of love, the tingling feeling like i’m weak in my knees. Feeling my air breathe backwards.
The fleeting nightingale singing her song never minded the sound of her own voice in my dreams. For some reason I wanted her, with a longing poison that ridiculed me.

“Please”

Could she take you away. -A girl like that
