Surviving without bookface.
less of the online web of lies streaming through your phone; working with vulnerable clients. The precedence of vulger,
surpass the pain of getting much older you know we’re missing all this time. And bring out the countries most common money scolder, taking my friends life with them. Déjà vu, take me away to when i was younger, away from the straight line.

Tired of dependence. Remember your name, date of birth, not the user, your number, your likes on your picture, the time you were born not the bio, your age, state your tumblr catch phrase, just your life, your memories,
the days your life was perfectly unprecedented. The memories, not your mistakes you made, say cheese! Should have held your stomach in more tightly.
People please. Slide in to my DM’s tell me we’re a match made in heaven baby.
Online men you frighten me.
