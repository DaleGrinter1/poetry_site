A catastrophe, carrying the weight of the expectations of the world, sitting in the backseat, call it reality. Wanting to be almost good enough but never loud enough to be heard, don’t be too mean either.

As if the going height wasn’t tall enough, the anarchy falls further under a roll of know-it-all’s, wanting to break, drawing mistakes from a runover screw-over that only tells you your mistake is you.

Your pleasurable to none other than yourself; holding your lies to mush them up. To be a voice that suffers no longer than your words consisted of crude talkers; a rolling stone coming to take your head off.

You wouldnt have let me make the worst pleasurable presentation to the expectational formation: turning my pain into the language of art. So I shut the door, let me laugh at you.
Since lying on the basement, and feeling no good on the floor,
I found meaning to my life, not regretting to close that.
And we don’t talk to eachother, so no picking fights. Catastrophes don’t exist for me anymore.
