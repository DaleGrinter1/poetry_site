Personable in a day,
raiding Archibald’s prize in a month, I loved and I lust.
Feeling the walk of the waffle tower under the fine european man’s most oppressive powers.
Consuming nothing but cranberry madness from the glistening sun, feeling tedious in the worlds most compelling sour-worm characters.

Masses of armour backtracking; stating I want to be more interesting. In all the while, much more than a number, less than something for a nighttime’s storytelling;
don’t pretend the daytime isn’t warm in internal slumber, locked away in your lavish castle brick building.

As if happy to be presented backstage, feeling much broker. While the heavenly fat I get from all this sugar is what keeping me; away from reaching much older; counting on reaching all my blessings that I made it further than the missionary’s resentful playing fields. With each boulders over me, sore of aiming higher. Tired of cooperating with boring things.
