We were young kids, using our big spaces the dream world we made; reading out our dreams allocated in our living room. The carpet turned us a centre stage.

Growing up, i’ve seen other people in our lives that’ll go about their blessings in different ways; we can be cruel and impatient, a mind set where nothing good ever stays at night. They think laughing isn’t important.

I don’t see a mistress of struggle in you. Or a misfit of nature’s own good, in blue and dust, You bring out all the wonder in me. You make a playground all the much more understood.

No more pity, no selling out our dreams to the stock broker for a silver shillings, stuck with the still-lives from the city. Minds of you own, still the little lovely things we were. I saw you wondering today, and as if you could see me. Your still quite as lovely as you were, make the world good for me.
