Hey how does it feel knowing about Tom Sawyer? he felt the wind break even; basking in his joy, piccadilly poppy boy making his way along the long Mississippi River.

Much more enticing when we care for it, we want to feel laughter, not boring afterpills that teach us littl’-to none;
lessons about our lives. I see so much life in the great ocean water. Wide open country roads, empty for long motercycle rides.

A history of Micheal Angelo’s angels;
Put to the test to his Marther Stewart’s award-winning cheese-to-slab pies.
We must’ve lived inside a box; I’d like to say we hid behind our mums and soft teddy’s every time we wanted to cry. But so it goes,
you’ll wanna get lost down the Mississippi River, at least once in our lives.
