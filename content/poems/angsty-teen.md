I am a weirdo, a very strange girl.
Normal is exhausting and boxes mean one thing.
Can i be entertaining, an energetic friend
or deep, emotionally understanding; daughter
a relentless, passionate art student.
A writer, a dancer, or a singer in the shower,
i’m an explosive machine if that fits, a meglomaniac on a dance floor.
never really fitting in anywhere.
as if my head never needed drugs, my brain is explosive enough to give me a wakened high.
i’ll fall in love with other people’s madness
with anything else out of the ordinary, making me feel free and complete from my sadness.
i’ve put myself through a lot of grief. Im 18.
and i promise when i heal the wounds that have been sent for me i’ll free myself to the limelight. I might become the maddest bitch you’ve ever seen, but i’m deep inside my prophesies, i’ll need some sleep tonight.
