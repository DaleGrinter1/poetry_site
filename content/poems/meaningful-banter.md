Meaningful banter
Creating a little’ lovely thing.
Craftful beer over a nightful of laughter, making up the moon-lighting.
Ain’t it such a paradise where we made it out together?
Feels like only 2 weeks ago we were still dancing. Oh to be there with you now; I knew it would only upset you later.
Take me away; where somehow, I can be listening with no talking.
Don’t worry or forget; or begin to resent the times we walked alone all these years.

Become my new years kiss, with no promises of tailoring more than you can bare.
Ageing is hard, so all i’m saying is don’t commit to me forever.
Before you say sorry in the morning, arch your eyes to the quiet place of nowhere where the the strings are hanging down.
Where there is no more stressing;

i’ll be seeing you around, Mr. Rose Wine
