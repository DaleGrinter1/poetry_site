Love pays for its keep; you defended laughter from a kid.
If you stoped her reading, you could see the paused silence in her breathing; she carries ink inside her pen.

Im not a kitchen appliance, or a bad car you couldn’t keep.
Let’s forever fathom the masquerade act creeping underneath your cool breath, that turn to soil, evidently breathing into the premature leaks that make up your car,
not breathing in anymore oil.

Sweet texts, it didn’t happen; left on read, my boiled blood looks like it’s piling open, it must have been a little joke, shouldn’t make it so deep.
Tired of having lived with a long walking milestones between who she is and who i’m born to be.

Little poems only overshadowed by self righteous girls born with a little bit too much sadness, a bit too much immaturity. but Forgivenesses and so on;
Love kept my words open. Breathing in now, careful, my masquerade runs deep
