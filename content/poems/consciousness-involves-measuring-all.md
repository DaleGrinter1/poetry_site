Consciousness involves measuring all the possibilities that are still. As time turned out; so did the hopes it wouldn’t of given away all the fine possibilities arriving with a divine 5.7ish world chapter.

Their reassurance was quiet, and i’m holding on like a hollow oak tree with all tranquility inside.
I saw it; lit up in flames; at the same moment it reminded me where freedom is from.
Firing old oak; brisque gem stones, catching fine emerald green from the light.

Don’t humans ought to love beautiful things like it’s a crime?

You’d be utterly crazy before you believe it’s best to live conventionally in an expectational life. As long as life is still strange; it is as they told us. through each winds, when it catches the breeze or produces these mass mountains that race you down like lava streams. As long as every word still hears us.

Then the world isn’t a loosing game, it still forgives us.

Still burning from oak flame.
