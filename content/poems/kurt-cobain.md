I want to live like the mundane.
Grasp the sweetness on my lips under the pervasive touch, the universes mercy I live in.
It’s ageless;
could you not be another year, glamorous children drinking all they can fit in, rolling and shooting up.
For the times that i felt insane and useless.
I was singing and dancing in the back of my head.
And for the the first time; i’m uncompromising to machines and Miss Matchmaker.
Scared that the sweetness runs low in the city; runs roads that’ll wash up all the sweetness leaving us.
People, narcissists, kings.
Characters at the bar who like sweet drinks, shiny silver cups that eat up our bank accounts.
