The sun crept closer; on his beautiful daughter.
Complacent blue lights docking this ships tenders on the water.
They found there; internal moon-shine, that kept their mistakes, enticing us now.
The power-plug grew fleeting against the tides. Should have started a fire, in a night so pretending.
Stained a footprint on my life; all these years.
All these years stuck in the surface where we came from.
Convinced feeling at home would be better than swimming alone swallowing our fears.
It’s a crying shame we were the moon-shine.
And I kept it from you; all of these years.
My souls on the fire.
