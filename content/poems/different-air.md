i’m moving to different air
solace to my emotional state
so listen thoughtfully to my being
rigid truth
move other ways
speak is your truth baby thoughtlessness is enough to hinder
much to my surprise your happy
leaving your body
breathing in different air
welcome to my revolution
my reflex of truth
move to think of you
laugh at all the hidden realities
move away from your ways
leaving with the days passing
alive state of mind
