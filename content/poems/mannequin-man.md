Smart enough to be naieve,
happy enough to be in mind. On a tangible high enough to have the thoughtlessness.
Admittedly i’m waiting on the line for you.

And the camera states, your art, house of eyes; keeping my mind fixed on the mannequin man. Step closer toward’s your prize. Walk to the places in this world for more meaningful status or connection. The wildest glares far beyond my insatiable imagination.

I won’t dismiss the passionate glances, your meaningful talk, or your pride. You are like home to read; while letting myself fall deeper inside the heart attack you feed me; nicer than artificial sweetening. A double headed ra-ttle sword,
be careful as your reach underneath the suit and tie. A blessings lottery for more than one nights happiness; life on beautiful tinfoil.
You make me believe is all mine.
