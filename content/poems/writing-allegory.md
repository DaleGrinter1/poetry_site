Writing is an allegory. 
A measure of time before my self-deserved matrimony; I now pronounce you husband and life.
I feel as though i’m different from the past beneath me; inside a depth all the completely alive.
We all became over a slowly crackled undertone; unshackled beneath the coral seaweed; underneath our water that held our bones deep.
I mashed up the pieces for you; give me anything but a new ring, to explain the happiness i’m feeling. 
Give me smashed avocado, spicy seasoning. 
A photo perfect enough to explain my level of understanding for all my indifferences, my many bad influences, 
On toast please with green-bean garnish flakes for dinner.
Spooned pumpkin spiced late for all types of coffee.
Matrimonial to my premeditated happy days of thinking bigger.
A broccoli plate for you; lovely Mr. Universal guy. 
Living with a grander canyon, a deeper amusement park.
