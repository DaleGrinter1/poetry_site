I’m still patient enough beneath your fingertips.
Waiting for your angel-like madness, your pointnent features on your face.
Revealing a realness in me.
Moving away from feeling like the bricks would restlessly break off between us. No freedom to shying away from a conventional existence; when soulmates are two people dancing and love exists.
