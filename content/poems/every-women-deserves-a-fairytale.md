“Every women deserves a fairytale.” 

Much to your comprehension of what a fairytale is, tonight is definitely not; a seeming-less underlining of warmth that had us reading “princes are bound to save you.”

Im sorry no one knows what that asshole is thinking; or why he’s hearts tugging through your chest. I’ll tell you, I wouldn’t want a chance to miss you read those wedding vowels aloud, scream your hellhound; i’ll sing it with you.

The sound of the smashing chocolate cake on the mother in-law’s face for never believing or trusting you; in a ceremonial ring of the mummy boy’s distaste.

As though you already know what the meaning of life is, don’t forget breathing.
Since the ambulance is on its way. The prince charming package didn’t come with a medicine degree, or a PHD, so unfortunately he can’t save you; but your pulse is increasing; you're going to be okay.
